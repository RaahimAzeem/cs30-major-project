# Beta Testing 

## Programmer's advice:
- Good game, it works properly when I played this game.  
- Add a highlight function when it highlights all the other cells which have the same number as the one clicked. 
- Should add a victory screen at the completion of the game. 
- Should add a hint button if players get stuck, which will reveal 1 free number block. 
- Should have sound effects.

## Non-Programmer's advice:
- Well made, the game operates perfectly when played.
- The instructions are clear for the player to understand.
- All options are working fine.
- Should add a victory sign or 'you win' sign at the end when the game is completed.
