# Major Project Proposal

## Description
Sudoku

## Needs to Have List
- An interactive screen allowing the user to go to different screens (e.g. home screen, game screen)
- Set of instructions on how to play the game
- An interactive grid where the user can type in the numbers in the desired cells using keyboard.
- Use backtracking algorithm to solve any Sudoku level and save the solved grid. 
- Check whether the number typed by user is correct or wrong.
- Once user gets all the correct answer, display a winning message.
- If user makes more than a certain amount of errors, the game should end.
- More than 1 difficulty level.


## Nice to Have List
- Randomly generate different grids for each level, each time. 
- Allowing the user to place in numbers by clicking a number from a number row on the screen along with the option of using the keyboard or the numpad.
- Making it responsive so that it works on any device.
- Sound Effects
